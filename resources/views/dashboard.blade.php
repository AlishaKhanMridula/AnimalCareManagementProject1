 <div class="city1"><strong>Animals are familiar creatures to most of us. We are, after all, animals ourselves. Beyond that, we share the planet with a remarkable diversity of other animals, we rely on animals, we learn from animals, and we even befriend animals. But do you know the finer points of what makes one organism an animal and another organism something else, such as a plant or a bacterium or a fungus? Below, you'll find out more about animals and why they are unlike the other lifeforms that populate our planet.
   <p>The oldest evidence of life dates back some 3.8 billion years. The earliest fossils are of ancient organisms called stromatolites. Stromatolites were not animals—animals would not appear for another 3.2 billion years. It was during the late Precambrian that the first animals appear in the fossil record. Among the earliest animals are those of the Ediacara biota, an assortment of tubular and frond-shaped creatures that lived between 635 and 543 million years ago. The Ediacara biota appears to have vanished by the end of the Precambrian.The oldest evidence of life dates back some 3.8 billion years.

   <p>Animals need the energy to power all aspects of their lives including their growth, development, movement, metabolism, and reproduction. Unlike plants, animals are not capable of transforming sunlight into energy. Instead, animals are heterotrophs, which means they cannot produce their own food and must instead ingest plants and other organisms as a way to get the carbon and energy they need to live. </P>
   <p>Unlike plants, which are fixed to the substrate in which they grow, most animals are motile (capable of movement) during some or all of their life cycle. For many animals, the ability to move is obvious: fish swim, birds fly, mammals scamper, climb, run, and mosey. But for some animals, the movement is subtle or restricted to a short period of their life. Such animals are described as being sessile. Sponges, for example, are sedentary for most of their life cycle but do spend their larval stage as free-swimming animals. Additionally, it has been shown that some species of sponges can move at a very slow rate (a few millimeters per day). Examples of other sessile animals that move only very minimally include barnacles and corals.</p>
